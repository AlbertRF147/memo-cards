# Memo Cards

### Concentration (card game).

From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(card_game)):
> Concentration is a round game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.

There are 2 main pages controlled by a react router (SPA):
- `/` => menu
- `/game` => where the game is played

There is a menu the user can always open. From there the user can start/restart the game, and also change the number of cards to play. Once the game starts, a timer will keep track of the time taken to complete the game. The idea is to add a score board in the near feature.

TODO:
1. Add react tests.
2. Add an attemps counter.
3. Add a score board.
4. Add a sign-in functionality.
5. Store results per user.
6. Add 404 page.
